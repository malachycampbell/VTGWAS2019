## Datasets 
The two datasets are for the rice diversity panel. There is some overlap between the traits between the two. The major difference is the number of markers.

* Rice44k: SNP data are in Plink data for 374 accessions. The phenotype data is for 27 traits recorded on 374 accessions. You will need to use the PlinkID column in the phenotypic data to match with the identifiers in the plink SNP data. No filtering has been done at the SNP level.
* RiceImputed: This is the same dataset that was used for days 1 and 2. Some additional phenotypes are provided. Genotypes are in rrBLUP format (first three columns are marker names, chromosome and position). Markers are coded as 0, 1 and 2.
